Project Overview
This repository contains the Week 2 progress for the LearnSphere mobile application. The goal for this week was to transition from wireframes to a functional Flutter UI prototype consisting of four core screens.

 Features Implemented
Onboarding & Splash Flow: A multi-step onboarding process with "Next" and "Get Started" buttons.

Home Screen: Features a personalized "Welcome" message, a visual progress tracker (60% completed), and a list of enrolled courses.

Program Listing: A dedicated screen displaying available programs such as "Introduction to Flutter" and "Advanced Data Structures".

Program Details: Interactive cards that navigate to a detailed view showing course duration (e.g., 8 weeks), difficulty level, and learning objectives.

Bottom Navigation: A functional navigation bar to switch between Home, Courses, and Profile views.
